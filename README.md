# Real-Estate-Price-Prediction-ML

🏡 Real Estate Price Prediction
This project uses machine learning techniques to predict real estate prices based on various housing features. It includes data cleaning, exploratory analysis, feature engineering, and model training to forecast housing prices with improved accuracy.

📌 Overview
The notebook walks through:

Data preprocessing and cleaning

Exploratory data analysis (EDA) using visualizations

Feature selection and engineering

Model training using supervised regression algorithms

Evaluation using metrics like RMSE and R²

⚙️ Tech Stack
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)

Jupyter Notebook

Machine Learning: Linear Regression, Ridge, Lasso, etc.

📈 Dataset
The dataset used is a publicly available housing dataset containing attributes such as:

Number of bedrooms and bathrooms

Living area (sqft)

Location, condition, and construction year

Price

🚀 Results
The final model was evaluated using RMSE and R² score. The pipeline was optimized for improved accuracy and reduced overfitting. Feature engineering and regularization significantly enhanced performance.
